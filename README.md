# 🚦 Traffic Signal Simulation using State Pattern

This project simulates a **traffic signal** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a clean and modular architecture based on the **State Design Pattern**.

---

## 🧠 Design Pattern: State

The **State Pattern** is used to model the different signal lights as distinct states:
- **Red**
- **Yellow**
- **Green**

Each state encapsulates its own behavior and transition logic, allowing the signal to move smoothly between states without conditional-heavy code.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Observe the traffic signal change between Red, Yellow, and Green automatically (or manually if implemented).

---

## 🎯 Features

- Fully functional traffic light simulation
- Uses the State Design Pattern for clear logic and maintainability
- Clean and simple UI built with HTML and CSS
- Easily extendable (e.g., add blinking lights or timers)

---

## 🛠️ Possible Improvements

- Add pedestrian crossing state
- Implement time-based countdown for each light
- Add control buttons (Start, Stop, Reset)
- Improve animations and transitions
